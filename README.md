# Weather-App

![User Journey Map Image](/weather-app/src/assets/MainImage.jpg)

Welcome to the weather app. You can search by city in the input field and you will be able to see the current weather information. 

This project was a great opportunity to learn:
- Dynamic api fetching
- How to use axios with APIs
- Input field functionality
- How to use a background image
- Conditional rendering using ternary operators

Get started:

```
npx i
```
Run the app:

```
npm start
```

## Future Developments

In the futyre I would like to:
-  make the search bar more dynamic, so that when you write, you will be provided with a list of city suggestions
- add more weather information
- add a 7 day forcast
- add 'my cities'
  - also option to remove them

Many thanks for your time, Leo
